// ==== Task -------------------------------------------------------------------

/// An asynchronous task (just "Task" hereafter) is the analogue of a thread for
/// asynchronous functions. All asynchronous functions run as part of some task.
///
/// An instance of `Task` always represents a top-level task. The instance
/// can be used to await its completion, cancel the task, etc., The task will
/// run to completion even if there are no other instances of the `Task`.
///
/// `Task` also provides appropriate context-sensitive static functions which
/// operate on the "current" task, which might either be a detached task or
/// a child task. Because all such functions are `async` they can only
/// be invoked as part of an existing task, and therefore are guaranteed to be
/// effective.
///
/// A task's execution can be seen as a series of periods where the task was
/// running. Each such period ends at a suspension point or -- finally -- the
/// completion of the task.
///
/// These partial periods towards the task's completion are
/// individually schedulable as jobs.  Jobs are generally not interacted
/// with by end-users directly, unless implementing a scheduler.

// ==== Task Priority ----------------------------------------------------------

/// Task priority may inform decisions an `Executor` makes about how and when

/// ### Priority scheduling
/// An executor MAY utilize priority information to attempt running higher
/// priority tasks first, and then continuing to serve lower priority tasks.
///
/// The exact semantics of how priority is treated are left up to each
/// platform and `Executor` implementation.
///
/// ### Priority inheritance
/// Child tasks automatically inherit their parent task's priority.
///
/// Detached tasks (created by `Task.detached`) DO NOT inherit task priority,
/// as they are "detached" from their parent tasks after all.
///
/// ### Priority elevation
/// In some situations the priority of a task must be elevated (or "escalated", "raised"):
///
/// - if a `Task` running on behalf of an actor, and a new higher-priority
///   task is enqueued to the actor, its current task must be temporarily
///   elevated to the priority of the enqueued task, in order to allow the new
///   task to be processed at--effectively-- the priority it was enqueued with.
///   - this DOES NOT affect `Task.currentPriority()`.
/// - if a task is created with a `Task.Handle`, and a higher-priority task
///   calls the `await handle.get()` function the priority of this task must be
///   permanently increased until the task completes.
///   - this DOES affect `Task.currentPriority()`.
///
/// TODO: Define the details of task priority; It is likely to be a concept
///       similar to Darwin Dispatch's QoS; bearing in mind that priority is not as
///       much of a thing on other platforms (i.e. server side Linux systems).
